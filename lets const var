Reassigning to a const 'variable_name' is not allowed

To output multiple result we can use console.table([variable_name1, variable_name2, variable_name3]) instead of multiple console.log(variable_name); i.e.
variable1="tiktok"
variable2="facebook"
variable3="youtube"
console.table([variable1, variable2, variable3]);

Use of 'var' has issues of block and functional scope so we avoid var and use 'let'



// Datatypes and ECMA standards //
"use strict";               //treat all JS code as newer version

in initial days, we had many standards of javascript language i.e. different browsers used different standards of it.
